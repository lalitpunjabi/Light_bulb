# Tuggable Light Bulb with GSAP Draggable & MorphSVG
This interactive project demonstrates a draggable light bulb animation using the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library combined with MorphSVG and Draggable plugins. The goal of this project is to allow users to "tug" on the light bulb's cord, making the bulb responsive to drag movements. The SVG-based illustration provides an engaging and dynamic interaction experience.

Key Features:
GSAP Draggable: Enables smooth, interactive dragging of the light bulb and its cords.
MorphSVG: Used for animating the light bulb's shape and the cords dynamically as they are tugged.
SVG Illustration: Clean, vector-based design for scalability and crisp visual quality on any screen size.
Interactive Animation: The light bulb reacts to user input, providing a fun, realistic effect of pulling or interacting with the cord.
How It Works:
The user can drag the light bulb around, causing it to "tug" on the attached cords.
As the light bulb is moved, its appearance (such as the filament and cord tension) morphs to reflect the changes.
The motion is powered by GSAP for smooth, performant animations.
Technologies Used:
HTML5
CSS3
SVG
JavaScript
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for animations
MorphSVG Plugin for morphing SVG paths
Draggable Plugin for interactive dragging
